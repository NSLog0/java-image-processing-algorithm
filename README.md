# Image Processing with java
## About this project
The code I was developing on 3-4 years ago, While I studied on Third years in University. My purpose is to use the code in Senior project. Now I don't work in image processing field anymore. I decided to open code for everyone who is interesting in image processing. I want people to lean from my code. 

This project develop by using java, image processing concept and basic mathematical formula 


# What's inside the project.
### Image2D.java 
Main class, show example to use function

### Gaussian.java
The algorithm for bluring image, I use Gaussian distribution method

*  http://blog.ivank.net/fastest-gaussian-blur.html

### Grayscale.java
The algorithm for convert image to gray color, In this file I use Luminosity method, However I can read other method and example at below link

### Histogram.java
##### understand about histogram 
* http://www.tutorialspoint.com/dip/histograms_introduction.htm
* http://www.tutorialspoint.com/dip/histogram_equalization.htm

##### Math formula
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram

### Threshold.java
The algorithm to convert image to binary color (Separates pixels in an image into a foreground and background) , In this file I use Otsu's method,
However you must have understand about histogram first cause by threshold algorithm base on histogram
##### understand about Threshold 
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thresholding_(image_processing)

##### Math formula for Otsu's method
* http://www.ancient-asia-journal.com/articles/10.5334/aa.06113/
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otsu%27s_method

### EdgeOperator.java
The algorithm to find edge of image , I use Canny Edge algorithm 
##### Understand about  Canny Edge algorithm
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector

##### Definetion and example 
I follow by this link to implement canny edge and use convolution method to apply value to image
* http://dasl.mem.drexel.edu/alumni/bGreen/www.pages.drexel.edu/_weg22/can_tut.html

#### Definetion on OpenCv website
* http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/imgproc/imgtrans/canny_detector/canny_detector.html

### AutoBalance.java

## Remove or Add image area (Morphological)
##### Concept

## Read pixel color value 
### RGB.java
If you get value of pixle from RGB.java to access RGB value on Dicimal digit, You must use bitwise operators to shitf bit. R >> 16 , G >> 8 and B, Then add mask by (& 0xFF), See example in below link or file this project

# Convoluion 
## To apply vaule to image, You must have understand Convoluion method
